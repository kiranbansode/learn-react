MUST READ:

In the next lecture, you will be introduced to our demo backend that will be used in this course section: The Star Wars API.

I will use this page: https://swapi.dev/

Loading this page (and hence accessing this backend) might fail - if that is the case for you, you can use this alternative: https://swapi.py4e.com/
