# 25.02. React 18 & This Section

React 18 & This Section
This section was recorded with React 17 - therefore, in `index.js`, you will see slightly different code (that is the only change though - everything you learn in this section still applies!).

You can update the project to React 18 with these two steps:

1. `npm install --save react@latest react-dom@latest`

2. Update `index.js`:

Replace

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
	<Provider store={store}>
		<BrowserRouter>
			<App />
		</BrowserRouter>
	</Provider>,
	document.getElementById('root')
);
```

with

```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
	<Provider store={store}>
		<BrowserRouter>
			<App />
		</BrowserRouter>
	</Provider>
);
```

That's all - as mentioned, this is the only change. Everything you learn in this section is up-to-date with the latest version of React.
