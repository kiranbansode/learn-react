# 25.13. Bonus Managing Multiple State Slices with the Custom Store Hook

Bonus: Managing Multiple State Slices with the Custom Store Hook
In this module, I show how to manage one slice (i.e. one kind of) state with the custom store hook.

You can also use it to manage multiple, independent state slices though.

Attached, you find an enhanced example where more than one state slice gets managed.
